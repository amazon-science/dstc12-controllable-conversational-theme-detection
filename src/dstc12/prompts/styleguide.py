'''You are a useful and intelligent judge evaluating a theme label, a short, concise and useful textual description of a conversation at a callcenter.
Your task is to read the theme label guideline carefully and evaluate a theme label against it.



Theme Label Writing Guideline

An acceptable theme label is structurally and semantically well-formed according to the rules outlined in this styleguide.
Structurally well-formed means that the words and their arrangement in the theme label are acceptable.
Semantically well-formed means that the meaning and usability of the theme label are acceptable.

<rules>
{rules_content}
</rules>

Your task if the following: output Good if the theme label within <theme_label></theme_label> tags fully conforms to the rules within <rules></rules> tags, Bad otherwise.
Use the following format:

<explanation>put here all the subsections that this label violated, or "All good" otherwise</explanation>
<score>Good / Bad</score>

<theme_label>
{theme_label}
</theme_label>

SECTION_1_RULES = \
'''Theme labels exclude unneeded and undesirable words.

1. Theme labels should be concise (2--5 words long). They should only include essential words (see Word types and Examples below).
2. Essential words will primarily include content (open-class) words. Function (closed-class) words should be excluded.
3. Prepositions may be included as needed but should be avoided when there is a synonymous alternative label without a preposition.
4. Theme labels should also exclude context-sensitive words like pronouns (him, her, them, it, us, etc.) and demonstratives (this, that, those, etc.).

Word types

Content/open-class words:
    * nouns (items, insurance, information, order, etc.)
    * main verbs (check, inquire, add, explore, etc.)
    * adjectives (new patient, missing item, etc.)
    * other modifying words (shipping information, product options, etc.)

Function/closed-class words:
    * articles/determiners (the, a, etc.)
    * auxiliary verbs (have or be, as in I have eaten or I am eating)
    * copulas 
    * negation (not or -n't, as in not on time or didn't arrive)
    * conjunctions (and, or, but, etc.)
    * complementizers (clause-embedding uses of that, for, if, whether, because, etc.)
    * modals (can, could, will, would, may, might, must, shall)
    * question words (who, what, where, when, how, why) 

Context-sensitive words:
    * pronouns (she, he, they, it, her, his, etc.)
    * demonstratives (this, these, that, those, etc.)
    * temporal adverbs (yesterday, tomorrow, next week, etc.)
    * other context-sensitive language
    * one, as in I'm looking for a nearby branch. Can you find one?
    * deleted nouns (noun ellipsis), as in I found his order, but not yours __.

Examples

For a theme covering order tracking:
    * Good: track order
    * Good: track shipment
    * Bad: track an order (includes an article)
    * Bad: track their order (includes a pronoun)

For a theme covering finding the nearest branch of a chain:
    * Good: find nearest branch
    * Good: find closest branch
    * Bad: find nearest one (includes context-sensitive one)
    * Bad: check if there's a nearby branch (includes a complementizer if; includes a form of be)'''

SECTION_2_RULES = \
'''Theme labels are verb phrases that classify events.
1. A verb phrase begins with a verb and may include arguments or modifiers of the verb (such as a direct object).
2. The verb should be in its citation form, lacking any complex morphology such as tense or agreement suffixes.
3. The citation form of a verb is what would normally follow the infinitive to, such as sign up in I'd like to sign up.
4. Theme labels should not be other phrase types, such as noun phrases.
5. The verb phrase should describe a class of events.
Events are things that can be said to happen, unlike states (e.g. learn [event] vs. know [state]), entities (e.g. redeem [event] vs. redemption
[entity]), properties (e.g. complain [event] vs. angry [property]), and claims (report defect [event] vs. product is defective [claim]).

Examples

For a theme covering membership sign-ups:
    * Good: sign up for membership (verb phrase; describes a kind of signing up event)
    * Bad: signing up for membership (verb phrase, but verb is not in citation form)
    * Bad: membership sign-up (noun phrase; describes a kind of entity)
    * Bad: memberships (noun phrase; describes a kind of entity)

For a theme covering requests to check in early at a hotel:
    * Good: request early check-in (verb phrase; describes a kind of requesting event)
    * Bad: requested early check-in (verb phrase, but verb is not in citation form)
    * Bad: request for early check-in (noun phrase; describes a kind of entity)
    * Bad: customer wants early check-in (this is a claim)

For a theme covering reporting a defective product:
    * Good: report defective product (verb phrase; describes events)
    * Bad: reporting defective product (verb phrase, but verb is not in citation form)
    * Bad: believe product is defective (verb phrase, but describes a state rather than an event)
    * Bad: defective product (noun phrase; describes a kind of entity)'''

SECTION_3_RULES = \
'''Theme labels are informative and actionable yet sufficiently general.
1. Theme labels should be informative enough to substantially narrow down the set of possible customer issue resolution steps (the steps to resolve
the problem/need that drove the customer to make contact). For example, check balance is probably associated with a standard procedure for checking
the balance of a range of customer account types, but perform check is so broad that it could be associated with an extremely diverse group of issue
resolutions. Non-actionable theme labels may be excessively vague or uninformative, and hence not very useful.

Examples

For a theme covering appointment-scheduling themes:
    * Good: schedule appointments
    * Bad: ask about appointments (probably too general)
    * Bad: schedule appointment for next week (too specific)
    * Bad: schedule appointment for elderly parent (too specific)

For a theme covering adding a recognized user to an existing account or policy:
    * Good: add user
    * Bad: add one (too general)
    * Bad: add oldest child (too specific)

For a theme covering user password issues:
    * Good: reset password
    * Good: troubleshoot password
    * Bad: secure account (too general)
    * Bad: reset password again (too specific)

For a theme covering credit or debit card charge disputes:
    * Good: dispute charge
    * Bad: complain about charge (too general)
    * Bad: file card complaint (too general)
    * Bad: dispute charge for defective blender (too specific)'''
